To analyze the results of the out-of-the-box model, the performances on the different target variables will be compared across the different metrics. \Cref{table:Field_Com} shows the \textit{Accuracy, Null rate} and \textit{Cleaned Accuracy} for each extracted field.

        Invoice Number   & 70.625 \%   & 26.25 \%  & 95.76 \%\\
        Amount           & 86.250 \%   & 11.25 \%  & 97.18 \% \\
        Invoice Date     & 86.875 \%   & 10.6  \%  & 97.20 \% \\
        \bottomrule % separator line
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Comparison of Extracted Field}
    \label{table:Field_Com}
\end{table}

The fields where the model reaches the highest accuracy are \textit{Amount} and \textit{Invoice Date} with 86.250 \% and 86.875 \% respectively. The same two fields have the highest \textit{Cleaned Accuracy} with over 97 \%. The \textit{Invoice Number} field has the lowest accuracy with 70.625 \% and the highest \textit{Null rate} with 26.25 \%. The high \textit{Null rate} is the main factor for the relatively low overall accuracy. Looking at the \textit{Cleaned Accuracy} the model extracted the correct \textit{Invoice Number} 95.76 \% of the time whenever it returned a non-null output. Having the lowest \textit{Null rate} of 6.25 \% on the vendor field, the model's accuracy of 81.875 \% is close to the \textit{Cleaned Accuracy} of 87.33 \%, which is the lowest among all fields. 

It can be noticed that the results for \textit{Amount} and \textit{Invoice Date} lie within one percentage point across all categories. A potential explanation for this similarity is that both field have a recognizable data format and are typically found in a constant area of most invoices. In particular, the \textit{Invoice Date} is often written in the upper right are of an invoice, while the \textit{Amount} is usually displayed on the right hand side of the listing of the line items.

In turn, \textit{Vendor} and \textit{Invoice Number} occur in a less predictable way and have less recognizable formats, partly explaining the model's lower accuracy on those fields.

\end{figure}

To evaluate the usefulness of the model in a real-world context, the \textit{Document Score} indicates how many target variables have been correctly identified. \Cref{pic:results_1} shows the histogram of the occurrences of the document scores between 1 and 4. It can be noted that the model always identified at least one variable correctly. Also, 74 times all 4 field have been correctly identified, which is 46.25 \% of the time. Only 5 times just one field has been correctly extracted.

The plain distribution only shows the frequency of the individual scores and ignores that if the model identifies 3 fields correctly it also identified at least 2 fields correctly. Because of this, the reverse cumulate distribution shown in \cref{pic:results_1_cum} is used to indicate how many documents received a document score of at least the given score. 132 times and 82.5 \% of the time at least 3 fields have been correctly identified.

Another factor investigated for potentially having an effect on the model's performance is the nature of the input document. In particular, whether it is a digitally created PDF document of the scan of a printed document. The scanned documents have to be processed with \ac{OCR} before the data extraction. This adds an additional process step that may be the cause for errors. Because of this it is suspected that the model will have a lower accuracy on those documents. The comparison between the model's performance on digitally created PDF and scanned invoice documents is shown in \cref{table:Field_Com_Scan_PDF}.

\end{figure}

When comparing the model's performance between PDF and scanned invoices, on the \textit{Vendor} and \textit{Invoice Number} fields lower accuracies for scanned documents can be observed. The accuracy on the \textit{Vendor} field is more than 20 percentage points less compared to the results of PDF documents. On the \textit{Invoice Number} field the two accuracy scores are more than 30 percentage points apart. This finding supports the hypothesis that the model's accuracy is lower on documents that are processed by \ac{OCR}.
However, on the \textit{Amount} and \textit{Invoice Date} field the opposite can be observed. On both fields the model's accuracy is higher on the scanned documents.

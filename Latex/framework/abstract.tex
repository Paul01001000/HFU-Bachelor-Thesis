Document Understanding is the process of automatically extracting information from documents. Therefore, Document Understanding can be used to automate document-based business processes. Document Understanding techniques include Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Information Extraction (IE), and Named Entity Recognition (NER). For these tasks, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools from the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Processing are applied. Furthermore, Large Language Models (LLM) have promising functionality for Document Understanding tasks.

To test a state-of-the-art Document Understanding system, an invoice data extraction workflow has been developed using UiPath Document Understanding. The pre-trained invoice model of UiPath and a custom trained model have been tested with real invoice documents. The pre-trained model correctly extracted all the required fields for 46.25\% of the test invoice, the custom model for 62\%. As weaknesses, the processing of scanned documents and the extraction of fields with a high variance are identified. The results are evaluated as not convincing and instead the use of e-invoicing tools is suggested over AI-based Document Understanding for the case of automated invoice processing.
